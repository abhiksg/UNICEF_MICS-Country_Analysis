This project showcases a comprehensive analysis of UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) datasets, including household (hh), household member (hl), men (mn), women (wm), and children (ch &fs) data. The analysis involved intricate data wrangling techniques, merging multiple datasets to create a unified data structure, enabling the calculation of various socio-economic and health indicators.
The project employed tabulation and cross-tabulation methods to derive insightful statistics and uncover patterns within the data. Furthermore, advanced statistical techniques, such as logistic regression, were employed to model the relationships between various indicators and identify significant predictors.
